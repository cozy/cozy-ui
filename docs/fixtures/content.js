  short: `Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.`,

  long: `Byron expected his baby to be a "glorious boy" and was
    disappointed when his wife gave birth to a girl. Augusta was named after
    Byron's half-sister, Augusta Leigh, and was called "Ada" by Byron himself.

    Ada, aged four On 16 January 1816 Ada's mother, Annabella, at Byron's behest,
    left for her parents' home at Kirkby Mallory, taking one-month-old Ada with
    her. Although English law at the time gave fathers full custody of their
    children in cases of separation, Byron made no attempt to claim his parental
    rights but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada's
    welfare. On 21 April Byron signed the Deed of Separation, although very
    reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later. Aside from an
    acrimonious separation, Annabella continually made allegations about Byron's
    immoral behaviour throughout her life. This set of events made Ada famous
    in Victorian society. Byron did not have a relationship with his daughter, and
    never saw her again. He died in 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother
    was the only significant parental figure in her life. Ada was not shown
    the family portrait of her father (covered in green shroud) until her
    twentieth birthday. Her mother became Baroness Wentworth in her own right
    in 1856. Annabella did not have a close relationship with the young Ada and
    often left her in the care of her own mother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke who
    doted on her grandchild. However, because of societal attitudes of the
    time—which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any
    child acting as mitigation—Annabella had to present herself as a loving mother
    to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke
    about Ada's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case
    she had to use them to show maternal concern. In one letter to Lady
    Milbanke, she referred to Ada as "it": "I talk to it for your satisfaction,
    not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own." In
    her teenage years, several of her mother's close friends watched Ada for any
    sign of moral deviation. Ada dubbed these observers the "Furies" and later
    complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her.

    Ada, aged seventeen, 1832 Ada was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At
    the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision. In
    June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of measles. She was subjected to
    continuous bed rest for nearly a year, which may have extended her period of
    disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite being ill Ada
    developed her mathematical and technological skills. At age 12 this future
    "Lady Fairy", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted
    to fly. Ada went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with
    imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct
    wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various
    materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the
    anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the
    body. She decided to write a book, Flyology, illustrating, with plates, some
    of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a
    compass, to "cut across the country by the most direct road", so that she
    could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate
    steam with the "art of flying". In early 1833 Ada had an affair with a
    tutor and, after being caught, tried to elope with him. The tutor's relatives
    recognised her and contacted her mother. Annabella and her friends covered the
    incident up to prevent a public scandal. Ada never met her younger half-
    sister, Allegra, the daughter of Lord Byron and Claire Clairmont. Allegra died
    in 1822 at the age of five. Ada did have some contact with Elizabeth Medora
    Leigh, the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely
    avoided Ada as much as possible when introduced at Court.`
