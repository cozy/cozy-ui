Welcome on Cozy-ui documentation. Cozy-ui is largely based on [Material-ui v4](https://v4.mui.com/) so this documentation only presents the high-level components and the overridden Mui components.

You can find everything you need to know about cozy-ui there : <https://github.com/cozy/cozy-ui#readme>

Use left sidebar to pick a component and see how it works.
