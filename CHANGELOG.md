## Added
- Standalone compiled CSS
  If you do not want to use the library as Stylus placeholders and prefer using one compiled CSS with every available classes, yoou can do so.  
  In your terminal, type the following command (with `yarn` or `npm`):
  ```
  $ yarn build:css:app
  ```  
  It will compile the CSS file `app.css` into `build/styleguide/` folder.

## Removed
- Removed deprecated classes `.coz-sidebar`, `coz-error`, `coz-error--warning`, `coz-hidden`, `coz-desktop`, `coz-mobile`
- Removed exported classes like `.o-sidebar` & `.c-nav`
  You can't `@extend` classes as it doesn't exist anymore but you can `@extend` the equivalent placeholder. Just replace by the occurence you need and you're done! :)  
  `.o-sidebar` => `$sidebar`  
  `.c-nav` => `$nav`  
  `.c-nav-item` => `$nav-item`  
  `.c-nav-link` => `$nav-link`
- Removed global classes like buttons & utilities
  You have to declare explicitly button & utility classes.  
  If you use React, the best way is to use the `<Button />` [component](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-ui/tree/master/react/Button).
  If not, you should manually `@extend` those components like any other CSS components with their `$placeholder`.
  ```
  .c-btn {
    @extend $button
  }
  .u-visuallyhidden {
    @extend $visuallyhidden
  }
  ```
