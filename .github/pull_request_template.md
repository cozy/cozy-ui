If your changes have graphic impacts, it is useful to deploy a version
of the styleguidist to your repository.

```
yarn build
yarn build:css:all
yarn build:doc
yarn deploy:doc --repo git@github.com:USERNAME/cozy-ui.git
```

- [ ] Deployed the styleguidist
- [ ] Did you think of ARIA attributes if you are coding new components ?
